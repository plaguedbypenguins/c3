# "contrib/README"

The material contained in this "contrib/" directory are scripts that we have
found useful. They are not part of C3 proper as they are generally site
specific. They may require some modification for use by others to meet local
settings and/or current versions of C3. You are encouraged to read the
source code before using the scripts.

These are also useful as they show several ways that the C3 tools can be
scripted. Check the header of the individual scripts for a brief
description.
